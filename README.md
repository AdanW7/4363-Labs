# 4363-Labs
This Git Repo is where I will store my Fall'23 4363 Verilog labs.

This Repo is for my own personal use to imporve my skills using git.

If you are a student do not look to this repo for answers, do the labs honestly. Coming to this repo as a student currently enrolled in this course is scholastic dishonesty and goes agaisnt the course rules. 

Don't cheat yourself out of your own education, or get caught breaking university policy for something that isn't worth it.
